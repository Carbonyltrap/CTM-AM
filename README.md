# 🔬 CTM-AM Accelerates Anti-AGE Natural Product Discovery

CTM-AM was employed to accelerate the discovery of anti-AGE natural products 🌿.  
This approach enables the efficient construction of a methylglyoxal (MGO) adduct library 📚,  
leveraging carbonyl trap reaction features to rapidly identify MGO-trapped constituents in medicinal plants 🌱.

Furthermore, the method provides a versatile platform ⚙️ that can be readily adapted for profiling other reactive dicarbonyl species 🧪.
